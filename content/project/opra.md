[OPRAmachine](https://opramachine.com) has radically simplified the process of requesting public records in all 565 municipalities in New Jersey.
The web service has broken down barriers for individuals and organizations seeking to obtain authoritative information about New Jersey state & local government.
OPRAmachine has also provided visibilities to some of the challenges and legal issues that may arise when making requests under the OPRA law, such as when agencies delay.

## Features

* Submit & view public records requests
* Automatic publication of documents provided by the government
* Time tracking to ensure compliance with the law's deadlines
* A JSON REST API to ensure quick access to OPRA data
